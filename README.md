This project aims to develop a data-driven approach to poker decision-making by analyzing hand strength and probabilities to predict the optimal move (e.g., fold, raise, or go all-in).

## Description

This project aims to develop a data-driven poker decision system using learning from past data and analyzing features such as hand strength, hand types and the unique card ranks. Statistical models and machine learning are used to predict the best strategic action in a game, for example folding, raising, or going all-in, using probability. By considering various changing factors, the model determines trends and predicts wins under various situations. It enables players to make decisions in an informed way with greater potential for winning. Lastly, the objective is to help players enhance their strategy and decision-making.
